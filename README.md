# DC VOLTAGE REGULATOR 
I made this linear voltage regulator using an **L317T** IC, whose output voltage range is controlled and monitored by a potentiometer. The reason for making this board is to power my gernal purpose opamps used for various circuit testing.

## ASSEMBLE THE PCB:

The board is being manufactured by jclpcb and will be here in a few days. 

QUICK UPDATE: The boards finally arrived!!

I realized there is an issue with the silkscreen layer, the size of the names and values is too small, after I submitted my order on JCLPCB. I should have made them bigger.

I will post images of the completly soldered board later on
